## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned center a div usign display grid and flex and use the key @media to create the mobile responsive. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    body {
        width: 375px;
    }
    .
    .
    .
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep learning the responsive desing, specially the mobile-first workflow. Also, learn more about display: grid and
display: flex.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/i-did-it-with-flexbox-FYBF4gZh8) - This helped me beacuse it was an example or a template to me. In the code I can find solutions and ways to do what I want. I really liked this pattern.
